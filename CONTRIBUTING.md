# Contributing to HarnSpec

Thanks for your interest in contributing! HarnSpec is about keeping things lean, so our contribution process is too.

## Quick Start

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b my-feature`
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests: `pnpm test:run`
5. Commit with clear message: `git commit -m "Add feature X"`
6. Push and open a PR

> Note: The documentation site lives in the `codervisor/harnspec-docs` repository and is merged here as the `docs-site/` directory using git subtree. It's already included when you clone the repo - no additional steps needed.

## Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build all packages (uses Turborepo with caching)
pnpm build

# Development
pnpm dev          # Start web dev server
pnpm dev:cli      # Start CLI in watch mode

# Testing & Validation
pnpm test         # Run tests (with caching)
pnpm typecheck    # Type check all packages (with caching)
```

## Running the Web UI

HarnSpec uses a unified HTTP server architecture where the Rust server serves both the API and UI on a single port (3000).

### Development Mode

**Option 1: Separate Dev Servers (Recommended for UI development)**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Rust HTTP server (API on port 3000)
cd rust/harnspec-http
cargo run

# Terminal 2: Start Vite dev server (UI on port 5173 with HMR)
cd packages/ui
pnpm dev
```

Vite's proxy configuration automatically forwards `/api/*` requests to the Rust server on port 3000. This gives you fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for UI changes.

**Option 2: Unified Dev Mode (Testing production-like setup)**

```bash
# Build UI once
cd packages/ui
pnpm build

# Run unified server (serves both UI and API on port 3000)
cd rust/harnspec-http
cargo run
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the UI served directly by Rust.

### Production Mode

In production, `npx @harnspec/ui` starts a single Rust HTTP server that serves both the built UI (static files) and API endpoints on port 3000:

```bash
npx @harnspec/ui
# or
npx @harnspec/ui --port 3001 --no-open
```

All CLI arguments are passed through to the Rust server. See `harnspec-http --help` for all options.

## Version Management

All packages in the monorepo maintain synchronized versions automatically. The root `package.json` serves as the single source of truth.

**Packages:**

- `harnspec` (CLI package - wrapper for Rust binary)
- `@harnspec/ui` (web UI package)
- `@harnspec/mcp` (MCP server wrapper)
- Desktop app repository: <https://github.com/codervisor/harnspec-desktop>

### Automated Version Sync

The `pnpm sync-versions` script automatically synchronizes all package versions with the root:

```bash
# Check current version alignment (dry run)
pnpm sync-versions --dry-run

# Sync all package versions to match root package.json
pnpm sync-versions
```

The script:

- Reads the version from root `package.json`
- Updates all workspace packages to match
- Reports what changed
- Runs automatically as part of `pre-release`

### Release Process

**Before Publishing:**

1. Update version in **root `package.json` only**
2. Run `pnpm sync-versions` (or it runs automatically with `pre-release`)
3. Update cross-package dependencies if needed (e.g., `@harnspec/mcp` → `harnspec`)
4. Run `pnpm build` to verify all packages build successfully
5. Run `pnpm pre-release` to run full validation suite
   - Includes: sync-versions, typecheck, tests, build, and validate with `--warnings-only`
   - The validate step treats all issues as warnings (won't fail on complexity/token issues)
   - For stricter validation before committing spec changes, run `node bin/harnspec.js validate` without flags
6. Test package installation locally using `npm pack`

**Version Bump Example:**

```bash
# 1. Update root version
npm version patch  # or minor/major

# 2. Sync all packages (automatic in pre-release)
pnpm sync-versions

# 3. Verify
pnpm build
pnpm test:run

# 4. Commit and publish
git add .
git commit -m "chore: release v0.2.6"
git push
```

**Why root as source of truth?**

- Single place to update version
- Prevents version drift
- Automated sync in CI/CD
- Simpler release process

### Docs Site Subtree

The docs are maintained in [codervisor/harnspec-docs](https://github.com/codervisor/harnspec-docs) and merged into this repo at `docs-site/` using git subtree. The docs are already included when you clone.

**Local development:**

```bash
cd docs-site
pnpm install    # install docs dependencies
pnpm start      # develop docs locally
```

**Pushing docs changes:**

```bash
# Make changes in docs-site/, then commit to this repo
git add docs-site
git commit -m "docs: your changes"
git push

# Push to the separate docs repo (maintainers only)
git subtree push --prefix=docs-site https://github.com/codervisor/harnspec-docs.git main
```

**Pulling docs changes from upstream:**

```bash
# Pull latest from the separate docs repo
git subtree pull --prefix=docs-site https://github.com/codervisor/harnspec-docs.git main --squash
```

### Monorepo with Turborepo

This project uses [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/) to manage the monorepo with pnpm workspaces:

- **Parallel execution** - Independent packages build simultaneously
- **Smart caching** - Only rebuilds what changed (126ms vs 19s!)
- **Task dependencies** - Dependencies built first automatically

**Packages:**

- `packages/cli` - CLI wrapper for Rust binary (published as `harnspec`)
- `packages/mcp` - MCP server wrapper (published as `@harnspec/mcp`)
- `packages/ui` - Web UI bundle (published as `@harnspec/ui`)
- Desktop app repository: <https://github.com/codervisor/harnspec-desktop>
- `docs-site/` - Git subtree merged from `codervisor/harnspec-docs` (Docusaurus)

**Key files:**

- `turbo.json` - Task pipeline configuration
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` - Workspace definitions
- `package.json` - Root scripts that invoke Turbo

**Build specific package:**

```bash
turbo run build --filter=harnspec
turbo run build --filter=@harnspec/ui
```

**Rust Development:**

```bash
# Build Rust binaries
pnpm rust:build

# Run Rust tests
pnpm rust:test

# Copy binaries to packages
pnpm rust:copy
```

**Important Build Order:**
When building for production/publishing, the UI must be built **before** Rust binaries:

```bash
# 1. Build UI first
pnpm --filter @harnspec/ui build

# 2. Build Rust (HTTP server will include UI dist)
cd rust && cargo build --release

# 3. Copy binaries (includes UI dist for http-server)
pnpm rust:copy
```

The `copy-rust-binaries.mjs` script automatically copies `packages/ui/dist` to the HTTP server's platform packages, enabling the unified server architecture.

## Testing

All code changes should include tests. We have a comprehensive testing strategy:

### Test Pyramid

```
         /\
        /E2E\        ← CLI scenarios, real filesystem
       /──────\
      /Integration\   ← Cross-package, MCP tools
     /──────────────\
    /    Unit Tests   \  ← Pure function logic
   /────────────────────\
```

### When to Write Which Test Type

| Test Type       | Use When                                    | Location                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unit**        | Testing pure functions, validators, parsers | `*.test.ts` alongside source                      |
| **Integration** | Testing workflows with mocked deps          | `integration.test.ts`, `list-integration.test.ts` |
| **E2E**         | Testing user-facing CLI workflows           | `__e2e__/*.e2e.test.ts`                           |
| **Regression**  | Fixing a bug (must fail before, pass after) | Add to relevant `__e2e__` file                    |

### E2E Tests

End-to-end tests live in `packages/cli/src/__e2e__/` and test real CLI commands against actual filesystems:

- `init.e2e.test.ts` - Initialization scenarios
- `spec-lifecycle.e2e.test.ts` - Create → update → link → archive workflows
- `mcp-tools.e2e.test.ts` - MCP server tool integration

E2E tests use helpers from `e2e-helpers.ts` to:

- Create isolated temp directories
- Execute real CLI commands

## Rust -> TypeScript Type Bindings

HarnSpec exports selected Rust types into `packages/ui/src/types/generated/`.

When you change exported Rust API structs, regenerate bindings:

```bash
cd rust
cargo test export_bindings -p harnspec-http
```

Then verify generated files are committed:

```bash
git diff -- packages/ui/src/types/generated
```

CI enforces this with a stale-binding check.

- Verify filesystem state

### Regression Tests

When fixing a bug, **always add a regression test**:

1. Name it: `REGRESSION #ISSUE: brief description`
2. The test must **fail without your fix**
3. The test must **pass with your fix**
4. Add to the relevant `__e2e__` test file

See `__e2e__/regression-template.e2e.test.ts` for the full template.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests in watch mode
pnpm test

# Run tests once (CI mode)
pnpm test:run

# Run only E2E tests
pnpm test:run -- --testPathPattern="e2e"

# Run with coverage
pnpm test:coverage

# Run with UI
pnpm test:ui
```

### Test Helpers

- `packages/cli/src/test-helpers.ts` - Unit/integration test setup
- `packages/cli/src/__e2e__/e2e-helpers.ts` - E2E test utilities

## Code Style

We use:

- TypeScript for type safety
- Prettier for formatting

Run `pnpm format` before committing.

## Philosophy

Keep changes aligned with HarnSpec first principles (see [specs/049-harnspec-first-principles](specs/049-harnspec-first-principles)):

1. **Context Economy** - Specs must fit in working memory (<400 lines)
2. **Signal-to-Noise Maximization** - Every word informs decisions
3. **Intent Over Implementation** - Capture why, not just how
4. **Bridge the Gap** - Both human and AI must understand
5. **Progressive Disclosure** - Add complexity when pain is felt

When in doubt: **Clarity over documentation, Essential over exhaustive, Speed over perfection**
